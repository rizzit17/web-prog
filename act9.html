    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>

        <p class="paragraph1">
            Hello! My name is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">Rishit Chaudhary</span>, and I am excited to share a bit about myself. I'm currently a <b>Btech 2nd year student</b> in <span style="color: blue;">Computer Science</span> branch, at <b>VIT Vellore</b>. I have a passion for learning new technologies and enjoy exploring various hobbies. In my free time, I love playing football, badminton, and spending time with my friends. Watching a favorite movie on repeat or starting a new web series and never finishing it are also my regular hobbies.
        </p>

    <h2>School Days</h2>
    <div>
        <p class="paragraph2 overflow-text">
            I kinda miss my school days when I didn't have to worry so much about uploading my digital assignments on time or studying a night before an important quiz. I was so carefree and limited to managing my time between playing football with friends or just completing my homework. As I grow up, I realize getting older wasn't a good idea. On the other hand, when I was younger, I just couldn't wait to get older and enjoy the benefits and freedom that comes along with it. Bunking classes in school felt so adventurous and now the 75% attendance rule feels a bit too much to handle.
        </p>

    <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
    <div>
        <p class="paragraph3">
            I have always been an overachiever since childhood, be it academics or sports. Participating regularly in events and competitions has made me what I'm today. I feel confident to present myself in front of people and have good control over speaking English. I'm grateful for whatever I've experienced so far. Life has its ups and downs, and we must be strong enough to handle the downs. I remind myself every day to improve and become the best version of myself.
