        Hello! My name is <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Rishit Chaudhary</span>, and I am excited to share a bit about myself. I'm currently a <b>Btech 2nd year student</b> in <span style="color: blue;">Computer Science</span> branch, at <b>VIT Vellore</b>.    I have a passion for learning new technologies and enjoy exploring various hobbies.   
        In my free time, I love <span style="font-style: italic; color: green; font-weight: bold;">playing football, badminton</span> and spending time with my friends. <span style="font-style: italic; color: green; font-weight: bold;">Watching a favorite movie</span> on repeat or starting a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: green;">new webseries</span> and never able to finish it are also my regular hobbies. I've been playing football since a very long time and I have a keen interest in badminton too. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;font-style: italic;">Playing video games</span> also keeps me busy sometimes.   
    </p>  

    <p>  
        I kinda miss <span style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">my school days</span> when I didn't have to worry so much about uploading my <span style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">digital assignments</span> on time or studying a night before an <span style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">important quiz</span>. I was so carefree and limited to managing my time between <span style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">playing football</span> with friends or just <span style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">completing my homework</span>. As I grow up, I realize getting older wasn't a good idea. On the other hand, when I was younger, I just couldn't wait to get older and enjoy the benefits and freedom that comes along with it. <span style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Bunking classes in school</span> felt so adventourous and now the <span style="color: darkblue; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">75% attendance rule</span> feels a bit too much to handle.
    </p>  

    <p>  
        I have always been an <span style="color: #9F2B68; text-decoration: underline;">overachiever</span> since childhood, be it academics or be it sports. Participating regularly in <span style="color: green; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">events and competitons</span> has made me what I'm today. I feel <span style="color: #9F2B68; text-decoration: underline;">confident</span> to present myself in front of people and have a good control over <span style="color: #9F2B68; text-decoration: underline;">speaking English</span> aswell. I may not be fluent enough but well enought to convey my message to the other person. I'm <span style="color: #9F2B68; text-decoration: underline;">grateful</span> for whatever I've experienced so far, and life has both ups and downs and we have to be <span style="color: #9F2B68; text-decoration: underline;">strong enough to handle</span> the downs in life too. I'm trying to <span style="color: #9F2B68; text-decoration: underline;">give up the habit of complaining</span> in life as we should accept everything the way it is. I tell myself everyday that I have the capability to get better and better and become the <span style="color: #9F2B68; text-decoration: underline;">best version of myself.</span>
